# with-Flask

The first dynamised version of the "Explore The City" project we are working on for the 2023-2024 graduation project. While doing this project, I used html, css and js as well as bootstrapt framework for the statics of our web page. You used Python's Flask framework to make it dynamic. I used SQLite database for user and city information. I keep the HTML pages in the templates folder and the photos and icons I use in the project in the static folder.
